# 📈 Linear Regression – Python Implementation

This repository contains a clean and easy-to-understand implementation of **Linear Regression**, one of the most fundamental algorithms in supervised machine learning.

The script demonstrates:
- How a linear model is fit to data
- How predictions are made
- How the best-fit line is plotted
- (Optional) Gradient Descent or Normal Equation method

Perfect for beginners, students, and anyone learning regression models.
